# Bancwr Frontend

The Nuxt web interface for the Bancwr bunker. It serves the dashboard and proxies bunker API
calls to the Rust backend, so the backend does not need to be exposed to the browser.

Package manager is pnpm, pinned in `package.json`. npm, yarn and bun are not supported here.

## Architecture

| Part | Address | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| Frontend (Nuxt) | <http://localhost:3001> | this directory |
| Backend (Rust) | <http://localhost:3000> | [`../backend`](../backend) |

Requests to `/api/bunker/*` are proxied to the backend by `server/api/bunker/[...].ts`. The
target comes from `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` and defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. Nothing else
is proxied.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running

The dashboard needs the backend running to show anything. Either start both from here:

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

Or run them in separate terminals, which gives clearer logs:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd ../backend && cargo run

# Terminal 2
pnpm dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3001>. The dev server port is set by `devServer.port` in
`nuxt.config.ts`.

To point the frontend at a backend somewhere other than `localhost:3000`:

```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://bunker.example:3000 pnpm dev
```

## Checks

```bash
pnpm lint        # ESLint; pnpm lint:fix to apply fixes
pnpm typecheck   # vue-tsc
pnpm test        # Vitest
```

## Production

```bash
pnpm build       # build to .output
pnpm preview     # run the built output locally
```

The container build runs `pnpm build` and serves `.output/server/index.mjs`; see `Dockerfile`.
